# Book Search Engine
1. github: https://github.com/eisforgene/book-search-engine
2. deployment: https://book-search-eng3.herokuapp.com/

## Description:
The challenge was to take a fully function Google Books API search engine with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with the Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Requirements: 
1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. Deploy the application to Heroku.
